[Original](https://github.com/JVoiceXML/FreeTTS)

FreeTTS is a speech synthesis system written entirely in the Java programming language. It is based upon Flite, a small, fast, run-time speech
synthesis engine, which in turn is based upon University of Edinburgh's Festival Speech Synthesis System and Carnegie Mellon University's
FestVox project.

Detailed documentation on FreeTTS can be found at https://freetts.sourceforge.io
